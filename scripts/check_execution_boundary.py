============================

Execution Boundary validator (CR-BP-33; EXE-001..010).

Codifies the Execution Boundary rules from CR-BP-33 §15 as machine-testable
per-record invariants. Today the catalog has zero records that carry
Workflow references; the validator is therefore a regression guard that
emits no findings on the existing 126 Business Process records and
prepares the catalog for the first opt-in Workflow / Task / Execution
contribution.

The validator inspects records in two tiers:

  Tier 1 (universal):
    Every record, regardless of type, is scanned for fields that
    would leak execution semantics into the structural layer.
    Today zero records carry such fields; the check is a
    forward-looking guard against accidental introduction.

  Tier 2 (opt-in):
    Records that declare `workflow_references[]`, `executed_by`,
    or a `composes[]` entry with execution-ordering annotations
    are additionally validated against EXE-001..010. A BP record
    with no Workflow reference is VALID (Execution mode = unmodelled);
    no finding is emitted (CR-BP-33 "Result (post-landing)" §3:
    "No retroactive Workflow instantiation. Existing BPs stay at L4
    conformance with no execution references. Workflow adoption is
    opt-in for new BPs that explicitly need an execution model.").

Rules (derived from CR-BP-33 §15):

  EXE-001 — Structural decomposition shall not encode execution sequence.
            For any record: composes[] entries MUST NOT carry
            execution-ordering annotations (`execution_order`,
            `sequence_index`, `step_index`, `temporal_sequence`,
            `before`, `after`, `precedes`, `follows`,
            `triggers`, `next_step`). Structural composition is
            part-whole only (CR-BP-33 §6).

  EXE-002 — `dea:composes` shall not be interpreted as execution ordering.
            For any composes[] entry: relationship_type=dea:composes
            MUST NOT be accompanied by ordering fields. (This is the
            type-level complement to EXE-001; together they prevent
            the "A composes B, B composes C ⇒ A→B→C executes in
            that order" inference.)

  EXE-003 — Workflow shall remain distinct from Business Process.
            A record with type=Workflow MUST NOT carry L2 BP
            classification fields (process_intent, process_type,
            process_specialization, process_audience). Workflow is
            its own concept (CR-BP-33 §5, §14).

  EXE-004 — A Business Process may have multiple execution Workflows.
            For any BP record: `workflow_references[]` is a list,
            not a singleton field. Multiple entries are permitted
            (CR-BP-33 §11: "Standard / Exception / Assisted
            Fulfilment Workflow" pattern). A singleton field
            (e.g. `workflow:` scalar) is rejected; use
            `workflow_references: [{workflow_id, relationship_kind}, ...]`.

  EXE-005 — Different Workflow implementations shall not automatically
            create different Business Processes.
            For any BP record: the presence of multiple
            `workflow_references[]` entries MUST NOT cause the
            BP record to declare duplicate `process_intent` /
            `process_type` axes (which would imply BP splitting).
            If a BP record has ≥ 2 workflow_references, its
            `process_intent` MUST remain singular (no duplicate
            axis declarations).

  EXE-006 — Execution actors shall reference existing Actor semantics.
            For any record with `executed_by` or `performed_by`:
            the value MUST be a reference to a canonical Actor
            (an id matching `dea:actor-*` or a declared reference
            via `actor_reference` field), NOT an inline string
            describing the actor. Inline actor strings (e.g.
            "the Sales team") are rejected; they bypass the
            Actor record semantics (CR-BP-33 §9).

  EXE-007 — Execution systems shall reference existing System semantics.
            For any record with `execution_system`, `system_ref`,
            or `executing_system`: the value MUST be a reference
            to a canonical System record (id matching `dea:system-*`
            or `system_reference` field), NOT an inline string.

  EXE-008 — Execution logic shall not redefine process identity.
            For any BP record with workflow_references[]:
            the BP's `identity.verb` and `identity.object` MUST NOT
            be duplicated on the referenced Workflow record (if
            resolved). Identity lives on the BP; Workflow is an
            execution realization, not a re-definition
            (CR-BP-33 §8).

  EXE-009 — Implementation detail shall remain outside the Business
            Process decomposition model.
            For any record: MUST NOT carry `api_sequence`,
            `database_procedure`, `application_control_flow`,
            `infrastructure_operation`, `script`, `code_ref`,
            `technical_runbook` (top-level or metadata.*). These
            belong to implementation models, not the process
            catalog (CR-BP-33 §12).

  EXE-010 — Every catalogued Workflow reference shall identify its
            relationship to the associated Business Process.
            For any BP record with `workflow_references[]`: each
            entry MUST carry a `relationship_kind` field whose
            value is one of the controlled vocabulary
            (`reference`, `operational`, `scenario`, `implementation`).
            CR-BP-33 §13 names this vocabulary explicitly.

Coverage on the live catalog (2026-09-12): zero records carry
Workflow references or execution-bearing fields. Expected findings:
EXE-001..010 = 0 across all 196 records. The validator is a
forward-looking regression guard.

Exit codes:
  0  all records satisfy all ten rules
  1  at least one record fails at least one rule
  2  self-test failure or I/O error
