========================

Activity Model validator (CR-BP-32; ACT-001..010).

Codifies the Activity Model rules from CR-BP-32 §15 as machine-testable
per-record invariants. Today the catalog has zero Activity records; the
validator is therefore a regression guard that emits no findings on the
existing 126 Business Process records (none of which are Activity-typed)
and prepares the catalog for the first Activity contributions.

The validator only inspects records whose `type` discriminator is
`Activity` (or records that opt into Activity decomposition by declaring
the `composes` shape defined in §14). The 126 canonical Business
Process records (`type: Process`) are NEVER inspected and produce
zero findings by construction (CR-BP-32 §17 "Result (post-landing)":
existing BPs without Activity decomposition are valid and remain at
L4 conformance).

Rules (derived from CR-BP-32 §15):

  ACT-001 — Every Activity belongs to a Business Process.
            type=Activity ⇒ belongs_to_business_process (top-level or
            metadata.belongs_to_business_process) is set AND resolves to
            a known `dea:process-*` id (best-effort: presence + pattern;
            full resolution to a BP record is enforced when at least
            one Activity exists in the catalog).

  ACT-002 — An Activity shall not be represented as a Business Process.
            type=Activity ⇒ type != "Process" (i.e., single-typed).

  ACT-003 — Every Activity declares a cohesion rationale.
            type=Activity ⇒ cohesion_rationale (top-level or
            metadata.cohesion_rationale) is a non-empty string ≥ 20
            characters (long enough to be a rationale, not a label).

  ACT-004 — An Activity declares at least one composed Task
            (decomposition reaches L4) OR explicitly marks the
            boundary rationale.
            type=Activity ⇒ either composes[] has ≥1 entry pointing
            at a `dea:task-*` id, OR `decomposition_boundary: l4-reached`
            is asserted (acknowledges the case where decomposition
            ends at the Activity itself per CR-BP-32 §12).

  ACT-005 — Activity composition uses dea:composes.
            For every composes[] entry, relationship_type must be
            `dea:composes`. Forbidden alternatives are recorded in
            CR-BP-32 §7: parent_activity, child_activities, decomposes,
            contains_activity. The validator rejects those.

  ACT-006 — Activity decomposition does not imply execution sequence.
            type=Activity ⇒ MUST NOT carry execution-ordering fields
            (execution_order, temporal_sequence, start_time, end_time,
            duration, sequence_index, step_index). Composition is
            structural only (CR-BP-32 §7).

  ACT-007 — Activity is not a synonym for Business Function.
            type=Activity ⇒ id MUST NOT match `dea:function-*` (the
            Business Function ID family; CR-BP-04 §4 reserves that
            family for Business Functions, not Activities).

  ACT-008 — Activity does not represent implementation detail.
            type=Activity ⇒ MUST NOT carry implementation-detail
            marker fields (script_ref, api_call_ref, system_operation,
            procedure_ref, work_instruction_ref, technical_step_ref).
            CR-BP-32 §12 establishes L4 as the catalog decomposition
            boundary; anything below L4 is implementation detail
            outside the catalog.

  ACT-009 — Activity does not introduce an independent execution model.
            type=Activity ⇒ MUST NOT carry workflow-modeling fields
            (workflow, bpmn, execution_model, workflow_definition,
            bpmn_process). CR-BP-32 §11 reserves execution semantics
            for CR-BP-33.

  ACT-010 — Activity traceability to parent Business Process.
            type=Activity ⇒ `belongs_to_business_process` is recorded
            in the parent BP's `metadata.activity_references` list (or
            the BP record declares `composes[]` entries whose
            target_id matches the Activity id). Bidirectional
            traceability is enforced whenever BOTH records exist
            in the catalog; for a solo Activity (parent BP absent
            or the catalog has no BPs at all) the rule degrades to
            "forward reference present".

Coverage on the live catalog (2026-09-12): zero Activity records.
Expected findings: ACT-001..010 = 0 across all 126 BP records (the
validator never touches BP records). The validator is therefore a
forward-looking regression guard, not a corrective gate.

Exit codes:
  0  all Activity records (if any) satisfy all ten rules
  1  at least one Activity record fails at least one rule
  2  self-test failure or I/O error
