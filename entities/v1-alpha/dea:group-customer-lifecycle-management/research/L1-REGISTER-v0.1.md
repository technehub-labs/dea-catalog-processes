# L1 Process Group Discovery Register v0.1

Status: re-derived-against-ECF-v2.5.0-2026-09-09 (CR-BP-28)
Programme: CR-BP-11 (research) -> CR-BP-13 (ratification) -> CR-BP-19 (v2.4.0 re-derivation) -> CR-BP-22 (register audit) -> CR-BP-28 (v2.5.0 re-derivation, no-op)
Repository: `technehub-labs/dea-catalog-processes`
Date: 2026-09-04 (research); 2026-09-05 (ratification v1); 2026-09-07 (ratification v2 / ECF v2.4.0); 2026-09-08 (audit reconciliation); 2026-09-09 (re-derivation v4 / ECF v2.5.0)
Scope: 49 ECF coordinates (7 domains x 7 lifecycle stages)
Authoritative artefacts: `change-requests/CR-BP-11-l1-process-group-discovery.md`; `change-requests/CR-BP-13-research-ratification.md`; `change-requests/CR-BP-19-l1-register-rederivation-ecf-v240.md`; `change-requests/CR-BP-22-register-audit-status.md`; `change-requests/CR-BP-28.md`; `entities/v1-alpha/dea:group-customer-lifecycle-management/research/l1-register.yaml`; `entities/v1-alpha/dea:group-customer-lifecycle-management/research/l1-candidate-universe.yaml`.

## Register-side counts (research disposition, ratified v4)

- 35 coordinates ratified-accepted (register v4; ECF v2.5.0; Activate normalized to backlog-deferred across all 7 domains)
- 14 coordinates backlog-deferred (Activate + Retire across all 7 domains)
- 49 total

## Audit-side counts (catalog landing reality, audited 2026-09-08)

| audit_status | Coordinates | Description |
|---:|---:|---|
| `landed` | 35 | Canonical `dea:group-*` exists at the coordinate's Process Context |
| `ratified-pending-landing` | 0 | `disposition=ratified-accepted` but no canonical L1 yet; planned tranche named per coordinate |
| `backlog-deferred` | 14 | `disposition=backlog-deferred` (Activate + Retire; transition scopes, not stable L1) |
| **Total** | **49** | |

The gap (0 `ratified-pending-landing`) is closed. **Register v2.5.0
scope is fully landed** — all 35 ratified cells have canonical L1
groups and all register L2 candidates. The remaining
14 `backlog-deferred` cells are the Activate/Retire lifecycle
transitions (CR-BP-19 doctrine: lifecycle transitions are not stable
Process Group operating states).

The v3 -> v4 re-derivation (CR-BP-28, 2026-09-09) is a no-op for the
disposition axis: the ECF v2.5.0 transition (CR-ECF-008 +
ADR-ECF-003, Domain 6 `OperationsAndEnablement` -> `EnablementAndOperations`)
was a label-only rename. No coordinate was added, removed, or
re-scoped. Register audit remains 35 / 0 / 14.

See CR-BP-19 for the v2 deferred_rationale (Activate and Retire are
lifecycle transition stages, not stable Process Group operating
scopes), CR-BP-22 for the audit_status axis design, and CR-BP-28
for the v2.5.0 re-derivation.

## 1. What this register is

A research-only, evidence-bound register of candidate L1 Process Groups across the 49 ECF coordinates. Every coordinate carries an explicit disposition. No canonical L1 records are created in this register; the register is the input gate for CR-BP-12 (L1 Process Group profile + schema) and CR-BP-13..BP-19 (seven-domain admission tranches).

## 2. Disposition Policy

| Disposition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `accepted` | Coordinate carries at least one L1 Process Group candidate supported by internal OpenDEA canon or by external-framework evidence E3+. |
| `deferred` | Coordinate carries zero, weak, or overlapping candidates. The L1 group cannot be defensibly bounded yet. A `deferral_reason` is mandatory. |
| `unresolved` | Internal evidence contradicts itself or boundary overlap is unresolved. Carries the conflicting pair. |
| `no-candidate` | Coordinate legitimately carries no L1 group (ECF legitimately-absent clause). |

## 3. Disposition Counts

| Domain | Accepted | Deferred | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| GovernanceAndExistence | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| StrategyAndDirection | 6 | 1 | 7 |
| AgencyAndOrganization | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| PartyAndRelationship | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| ProductAndValue | 6 | 1 | 7 |
| EnablementAndOperations | 6 | 1 | 7 |
| FinanceAndAccounting | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| **Total** | **38** | **11** | **49** |

The v1 totals (38/11) shown above are the original CR-BP-13 ratification
counts. They have been updated by:

- **CR-BP-17 / CR-BP-18** (Domain enum migrations): Domain renames + ID-family reconciliation; no count change.
- **CR-BP-19** (register v2 re-derivation against ECF v2.4.0): 35 ratified-accepted / 14 backlog-deferred (Activate normalized to backlog-deferred across all 7 domains; previously only 3 Activate cells were deferred). See the register's `ratification.version=2` block.

The **v2 register counts** (authoritative as of 2026-09-07):

| Domain | Accepted | Deferred | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| GovernanceAndExistence | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| StrategyAndDirection | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| AgencyAndOrganization | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| PartyAndRelationship | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| ProductAndValue | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| EnablementAndOperations | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| FinanceAndAccounting | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| **Total** | **35** | **14** | **49** |

No coordinate carries `unresolved` or `no-candidate` in v2; technology is held unmapped across the matrix (cross-domain finding C1), not as a `no-candidate` cell.

Per-coordinate `audit_status` (added by CR-BP-22) is recorded in `l1-register.yaml` and not duplicated here in full (49 cells); see `audit_counts` block in `l1-register.yaml` for the current landing reality.

## 5. Cross-Domain Findings

| ID | Topic | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Technology Management | Held unmapped across the matrix; technology is an L5 layer concern, not an ECF domain. No standalone Technology cell. | `CR-DEA-BC-04 N-006`, `R-004`; `boundary-decision-cand-019.yaml` |
| C2 | Change Management | Cross-cutting pattern at governance-existence x improve; referenced from peer coordinates. Not duplicated as separate L1 cells. | `CR-DEA-BC-04 R-005` |
| C3 | Partner Management dual-home | Primary at party-relationship x conceive; supply-side operation is legitimate participation. | `CR-DEA-BC-04 R-001` |
| C4 | Resilience, Innovation, Analytics | Resilience at governance-existence x improve; Innovation at product-value x conceive; Analytics at enablement-operations x operate. Recorded once at primary coordinate. | `CR-DEA-BC-04 R-006`, `R-007`, `R-008` |
| C5 | Marketing placement | Marketing is distinct from Customer Management. Customer-demand x conceive carries Marketing; party-relationship x operate carries Customer Relationship Management. | `CR-DEA-BC-04 N-002` |

## 6. Deferral Reasons (full list)

- governance-existence x activate: activation is typically modelled under enablement-operations x activate; governance activation is an attribute of governance operate.
- governance-existence x retire: governance retirement is rare and largely an attribute of operating-model retirement.
- strategy-direction x retire: retirement of supply and asset base is typically modelled under enablement-operations x retire with cross-reference.
- agency-organization x activate: workforce activation is often an attribute of build (hire-and-onboard) or operate (deploy-on-assignment).
- agency-organization x retire: workforce transition is often handled within HR operations.
- party-relationship x activate: first-time activation is mostly handled inside the L1 group Operate in practice.
- party-relationship x retire: customer exit is often handled within customer-relationship operations.
- product-value x retire: offering retirement often overlaps with customer exit and asset retirement.
- enablement-operations x retire: operations retirement is often handled within the operate group with a winding-down workflow.
- finance-accounting x activate: period opening and finance cutovers are usually handled within Operate.
- finance-accounting x retire: financial wind-down is often handled within financial stewardship.

## 7. Process Group vs Business Function

Process Group and Business Function are distinct catalog-topology constructs. Process Group groups process responsibilities by a coherent process-architecture concern beneath a Process Context. Business Function groups capabilities by organizational function and ownership. They are not synonyms, not subtypes, not aliases. Where they share a name (e.g. Financial Management), the relationship is a `relates-to` reference, not an identity.

## 8. What this register does not decide

- the governance schema for L1 Process Group records (BP-12);
- the validator for L1 group composition and MECE (BP-12);
- the L2 admission waves for the seven domains (BP-13+);
- the ID-family reconciliation between `dea:bp-*` and `dea:process-*` (CR-BP-04, separate);
- the promotion of Process Group to OpenDEA Core (BP-14, future, conditional).

## 9. Register v3 Audit Status (CR-BP-22; added 2026-09-08)

CR-BP-22 introduces an `audit_status` axis orthogonal to `disposition`.
The axis reconciles the research register's disposition (acceptance
decision) with the catalog's landing reality (canonical L1 Process
Group existence):

| audit_status | Count | Description |
|---:|---:|---|
| `landed` | 35 | Canonical `dea:group-*` exists at the coordinate's Process Context |
| `ratified-pending-landing` | 0 | `disposition=ratified-accepted` but no canonical L1 yet; planned tranche named per coordinate |
| `backlog-deferred` | 14 | `disposition=backlog-deferred` (Activate + Retire; transition scopes, not stable L1) |
| **Total** | **49** | |

### Per-Domain audit_status (2026-09-08)

| Domain | Conceive | Design | Build | Activate | Operate | Improve | Retire | L1 landed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|
| GovernanceAndExistence | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |
| StrategyAndDirection | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |
| AgencyAndOrganization | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |
| PartyAndRelationship | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |
| ProductAndValue | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |
| EnablementAndOperations | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |
| FinanceAndAccounting | landed | landed | landed | deferred | landed | landed | deferred | 5 |

### Planned tranches closing the gap

- `StrategyAndDirection` Design/Build/Operate/Improve (landed CR-BP-21a.1)
- `AgencyAndOrganization` Design/Build/Operate/Improve (landed CR-BP-21b.1)
- `ProductAndValue` Conceive (landed CR-BP-21c); Design/Build/Operate/Improve (landed CR-BP-21c.1)
- `EnablementAndOperations` Conceive (landed CR-BP-21d); Design/Build/Operate/Improve (landed CR-BP-21d.1)
- `FinanceAndAccounting` Conceive (landed CR-BP-21e); Design/Build/Operate/Improve (landed CR-BP-21e.1)

The audit script (`scripts/check_register_audit.py`) re-runs the
reconciliation and can be invoked after each landing tranche to
confirm the register did not drift.

## Note on cross-catalog references (added 2026-09-08)

The evidence line on this register includes a now-stale cross-catalog path
reference: `dea-catalog-business-capabilities/capability-financial-management`.
The pre-`CR-CATALOG-STRUCT-03a` flat layout has been retired; the current
canonical id is `dea:capability-financial-resource-management` (renamed at
`CR-DEA-BC-09` / `v1-alpha.3`; the former `dea:capability-financial-management`
is recorded in that entry's `aliases` field). The other names cited here
(ISO 37000, ISO 22301, ISO 56002, APQC PCF Financial Management Improvement,
SAP S/4HANA, COSO, IFRS, etc.) are external-standard citations and stay as
recorded.

The audit-reconciled content above is preserved for provenance. A
regenerated successor will cite the current canonical ids.
